# Medical Cost Personal Dataset: Linear Regression

This repository contains the analysis and modeling of the "Medical Cost Personal" dataset using Linear Regression. The objective is to predict medical insurance charges based on factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and other relevant variables.

## Dataset Description

The dataset provides medical cost data along with the personal details of individuals. This data is useful for predicting future medical insurance charges based on specific factors.

### Features:
- **age**: Age of the individual.
- **sex**: Gender (male/female).
- **bmi**: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
- **children**: Number of children covered by the health insurance.
- **smoker**: Whether the individual is a smoker or not.
- **region**: The individual's residential area in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
- **charges**: Medical insurance costs billed to the individual.

### Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to predict the `charges` using a Linear Regression model based on the provided features.



### Prerequisites

To run the project, you will need to install the following Python packages:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
